# Insta Reel

A real-time Instagram slideshow built with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Socket.io](http://socket.io/).

Submit a hashtag and the slideshow begins with the most recent photo.  It'll also begin to listen for new photos with the same hashtag being shared with Instagram and queues them up to display next.  Clicking the image will display the slideshow in fullscreen.
